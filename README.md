A DaVinci Resolve DCTL OFX plugin for balancing RGB channels and correcting faded film scans. It provides accessible and flexible tools for channel adjustment, mixing, and restoration preparation.

---

### Version

**Current: v1.4.0** (previous public base was v1.3.0; earlier versions in `previous_versions/`)

#### What's New in v1.4.0
- Added non-destructive preset system (10 starter corrective presets; toggling back to None restores baseline UI state).
- Internal pipeline clarified (see Pipeline section) ‚Äì ordering unchanged from spec; presets occur before global stage.
- Minor doc clarifications; no processing math changes versus v1.3.0.

#### What's New in v1.3.0
- Added `Preserve Luminance` (‚öñ) ‚Äì normalizes luma after per-channel stage only (global adjustments still shift exposure).
- Renamed channel "Copy" operations to clearer **Replace** (e.g. "Replace Red ‚Üí With Green").
- Locked processing order: Global ‚Üí Fade Correction ‚Üí Per-Channel ‚Üí Mixing ‚Üí Replace ‚Üí Removal ‚Üí Output.
- Consolidated UI/label/icon overhaul (option text simplification, Darken/Lighten composite combos, consistent icon set, duplicate definitions removed).

#### What's New in v1.2.0
- Removed final hard clamp to preserve full floating-point range during grading.
- Added `Output to Cineon Log` checkbox to inspect and balance channels safely without clipping.
- Added per-channel Offset controls (Red/Green/Blue) for finer pre-lift channel alignment.

### Features

-   **Film Fade Correction:** A dedicated tool to correct faded footage by adaptively enhancing contrast and saturation.
-   **Global & Per-Channel Balance:** Adjust Lift, Gamma, and Gain for all channels together or individually.
-   **Preserve Luminance (‚öñ):** Optional re-normalization of luma after per-channel adjustments.
-   **Channel Mixing:** Min/Max composites (e.g., `Red = min(Red, Green)` or `Blue = max(Blue, Green)`).
-   **Channel Replace & Removal:** Replace a channel's data with another or remove a channel entirely.
-   **Optional Cineon Output:** Linear ‚Üí Cineon-like log inspection mode.
-   **Presets (v1.4.0):** Non-destructive internal presets. See `docs/presets_companion.md` for details.

### Pipeline (Processing Order)

The image is processed through the following steps in a fixed order:

1.  **üé® Preset Application** (Internal temporary variables only)
2.  **üåç Global Adjust** (Offset / Shadows / Midtones / Highlights)
3.  **‚ú® Fade Correction** (Contrast + Saturation nudge)
4.  **üé® Per-Channel Adjust** (R/G/B)
5.  **‚öñÔ∏è Optional Preserve Luminance** (Post per-channel only)
6.  **üîÑ Mixing** (Darken / Lighten via min/max)
7.  **‚û°Ô∏è Replace** (Explicit channel copy)
8.  **‚ùå Removal** (Zero out channels)
9.  **üìú Optional Output to Cineon Log**

*Identity: Defaults with preset=None produce output ‚âà input (floating point tolerance).*
