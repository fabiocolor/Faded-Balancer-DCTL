Short answers for colorists and restoration technicians. For technical notes contact info@fabiocolor.com.

What is this?
- A small DCTL that helps fix faded film scans by rebalancing red, green, and blue and recovering midtone contrast.

When to use it?
- Use it early on scanned film that looks magenta/purple, washed out, or low in contrast.

Main controls (plain):
- Fade Correction: gentle contrast + color boost for faded footage.
- Preserve Luminance: keeps overall brightness similar after color tweaks.
- Global / Per-Channel: Offset, Shadows, Midtones, Highlights.
- Mixing / Replace / Remove: borrow or mute channels to fix bad dye layers.

Quick workflow:
1. Pick a preset that looks close.
2. Set Fade Correction for midtone contrast.
3. Adjust Global then Per-Channel sliders.
4. Use Preserve Luminance if brightness changed.

Safety tips:
- Work on copies; keep originals safe.
- Avoid extreme shadow boosts (noise).
- Small midtone changes first.

Install:
- Put `FadedBalancerOFX.dctl` in Resolve's LUT/DCTL folder and restart.
