### About Presets

The presets included with Faded Balancer DCTL are designed to be **non-destructive starting points**. They do not move the UI sliders. When you select a preset, the correction is applied internally. If you switch back to `None`, your original image and UI settings are instantly restored.

This workflow allows you to:
1.  Quickly test a corrective strategy.
2.  Refine the result using the main UI controls.
3.  Toggle between the preset and your manual grade without losing any work.
