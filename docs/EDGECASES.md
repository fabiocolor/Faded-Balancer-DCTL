# Edge Cases & Rules

1. **Channel Loss**  
   - If a channel is fully faded, use `Copy` before applying balance.

2. **Double Toggle**  
   - If both Copy and Remove are active for the same channel, *Removal wins*.

3. **Extreme Input Values**  
   - Clamp all outputs to [0,1].

4. **Neutralization First**  
   - Auto black/white pickers (future) must apply before any other adjustments.

5. **Disabled Sections**  
   - Disabled toggles must fully bypass that section.

# Edge Cases

- UI parameters must remain within ranges set in `DEFINE_UI_PARAMS`.
- Sliders default and step sizes follow BMD conventions (see GainDCTLPlugin).
- Tooltips (optional) are only supported in Resolve 19.1+ (see ColorPicker example).
- Max controls: 64 per UI type, enforced by Resolve.

# Edge Cases & Rules

- **Pipeline is fixed**: Global â†’ Fade â†’ Per-Channel (+Preserve Luma) â†’ Mix â†’ Replace â†’ Removal â†’ Output.  
- **Preserve Luminance**: applied only after per-channel ops, not global or later stages.  
- **Midtones**: constrain to [0.1..3.0] â†’ prevents unstable `_powf`.  
- **No final clamp**: allow values outside [0..1], handled by grading later.  
- **Mix conflicts**: each Darken/Lighten acts independently. Implementation: `_fminf`/`_fmaxf`.  
- **Replace conflicts**: process Râ†’Gâ†’B in fixed order to avoid recursion.  
- **Removal precedence**: Removal zeroes channels after Replace regardless of earlier settings.  
- **Cineon output**: applied last, per-channel only.  
- **UI Limits**: â‰¤64 controls per type.  
- **Float literals**: must end with `f` (e.g., `0.5f`).  

# Edge Cases & Determinism

- **Order is fixed**: Global â†’ Fade â†’ Per-Channel (â†’ Pres. Luma) â†’ Mix â†’ Replace â†’ Removal â†’ Output.
- **Preserve Luminance** only normalizes after per-channel; it does not affect Global or later stages.
- **Midtones extremes**: keep within [0.1..3.0] to avoid unstable pow().
- **No final clamp**: values may exceed [0..1] by design; grading downstream must handle ranges.
- **Mix conflicts**: multiple Darken/Lighten selections apply independently on each channel (pure min/max).
- **Replace conflicts**: each channel has at most one source; process order is Râ†’Gâ†’B in code to remain stable.
- **Removal precedence**: Removal zeroes channels after Replace regardless of earlier settings.
- **Cineon output**: applied last; no gamut or matrix transforms, per-channel only.
